Currently I'm mostly involved in administering my Virtual Machine or working on Linux based OS in my job. I do it from Windows OS because it's my favorite OS right now and it contains all tools which I need to use in my projects (like Unity or Visual Studio).
I really needed some tool to connect with my servers. Of course you can use PuTTY but for me it has really obsolete design and it has small amount of packages.

##### And there we have Babun
I have been using it for about six months right now and I'm really *pro console* guy right now :)

A few words from the authors :
>"Babun has a very small microkernel (cygwin, a couple of bash scripts and a bit of a convention) and a plugin architecture on the top of it. It means that almost everything is a plugin in the babunâ€™s world!" - [babun.github.io](http://babun.github.io/)

So - why do I use it?
Mostly because it has features like: 

* built in `pact` package manager - turns your terminal into even greater environment
* SSH
* Git shell
* UNIX tools on Windows
* Linux style copy/paste - click right mouse-button to paste something or highlight to copy
* Option "Open Babun here" on right click - open terminal with current directory as path
* looks awesome!
* open source with growing community


###### I will focus here on its pre-configured git features

First of all the console looks like this:

Out of the box we have all common used information in one-liner well prepared prompt. Username and hostname are visible on window title bar.

As you can see on authors' website there is bunch of git aliases:
```
gitalias['alias.cp']='cherry-pick'
gitalias['alias.st']='status -sb'
gitalias['alias.cl']='clone'
gitalias['alias.ci']='commit'
gitalias['alias.co']='checkout'
gitalias['alias.br']='branch'
gitalias['alias.dc']='diff --cached'
gitalias['alias.lg']="log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %Cblue<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --all"
gitalias['alias.last']='log -1 --stat'
gitalias['alias.unstage']='reset HEAD --'
```

Usage of `git status -sb` alias:

For me it is a little nice tool which makes my daily routine work much nicer. I always wanted to have great terminal on Windows and definitely it is the answer to my needs.
